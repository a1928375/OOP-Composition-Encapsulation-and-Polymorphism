# OOP-Composition-Encapsulation-and-Polymorphism

1. Composition:
  
     (1) Create a single room of a house using composition. Think about the things that should be included in the room. Maybe physical          parts of the house but furniture as well. Add at least one method to access an object via a getter and then that objects public            method as you saw in the previous video.
     
     (2) Then add at least one method to hide the object e.g. not using a getter but to access the object used in composition within the        main class like you saw in the video.
     
2. Encapsulation:

     (1) Create a class and demonstate proper encapsulation techniques the class will be called Printer. It will simulate a real Computer      Printer. It should have fields for the toner Level, number of pages printed, and also whether its a duplex printer (capable of            printing on both sides of the paper).
     
     (2) Add methods to fill up the toner (up to a maximum of 100%), another method to simulate printing a page (which should increase the      number of pages printed). Decide on the scope, whether to use constructors, and anything else you think is needed.
